            <h1>Soccer</h1>is a foot game which is <mark>4-how many players you want game.</mark> You have to kick the ball into the opponent's net to get a goal. <pre>1 goal is 1 point.</pre>Theres also a special role called Goalkeeper.
            The goal keeper stands infront of your goal and the oppnents goal. Trying to save the ball, they can use their hands to grab the ball and kick it back to their team. It seems like the goal keeper 
            role is unfair, but, they <code> limited area to walk around.</code> Its like a box around the goal and thats the limit they can go to. But what if someone gets hurt? Theres a thing called a free kick. If 
            a person accidently hurts the other team, the person that got hurt starts of with the ball where they got hurt. <abbr> if they touch the ball the game starts again.</abbr> Sililar thing is a penalty. If you get hurt in the goalkeeper's limited area you get a penalty. Which you put the ball 11 steps from the goal and shoot from There.
            Theres othere rules but theres are the most important.
