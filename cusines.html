        <h3>
            A cuisine is a distinctive style of cooking, defined by unique ingredients, techniques, and dishes linked to a specific culture or region, reflecting
             its history, geography, and available resources like climate, trade, and religion. It's a core part of cultural identity, encompassing everyday meals,
              festive dishes, and even fusion creations like Australia's<br>
             blend of bush foods and Asian spices, or
              international favorites such as Italian and Mexican cuisine, spread globally through migration and media.
