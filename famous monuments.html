             Great Pyramid of Giza - WikipediaThe Great Pyramid of Giza, built for Pharaoh Khufu around 2580–2560 BCE,
             is the oldest and largest of the Giza pyramids, an iconic tomb and the only surviving Wonder of the Ancient World, constructed
             from millions of massive stone blocks (mostly limestone) to form a colossal structure originally reaching 146.6 meters tall, encased in smooth white
             limestone that gleamed in the sun before being stripped away, showcasing incredible engineering for its era, with its internal passages
             leading to burial chambers.
